# Introduction
2D-GP is a FORTRAN project designed to numerically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) in two dimensions (2D). Solving the GPE allows for qualitatively accurate simulations of Bose-Eintein Condensates (BECs) at zero temperature.  
2D-GP solves the GPE using 4th order Runge-Kutta time stepping on a grid of points with regular spacing in both the x and y dimensions. User defined grid spacing and time step is supported.

### Installation
* Clone the git repository: `git clone https://github.com/Extigy/2D-GP.git`

* Run `./install` to setup. You can also run  `./install <install-dir>` to install to any desired installation location.

* New terminals should now be able to run  `make2dgp` anywhere.

### Running a Simulation
* Create a new simulation directory
* Enter the directory and run `make2dgp` to set up a simulation at your current location.
* Type `./gp&` to start the simulation.

### Editing Parameters
To run a simulation with custom parameters
*  Create a simulation as in **Running a Simulation** but do not run `./gp&`.
*  Edit `params.in` and run `make2dgp` again to reflect the changes.
*  Run `./gp&` to start the simulation.

Editable parameters along with descriptions and their default values can be found throughout this document. Hopefully, most editable parameters can be left as default.

# Gross-Pitaevskii Equation
2D-GP solves the GPE in 2 different dimensionless forms: the homogeneous system and the harmonically trapped system.  

The homogeneous system is used to fill the entire computational box with fluid, emulating superfluid liquid helium II. The harmonic trapped case is employed to emulate quasi-2D BEC experiments when confined using a harmonic trap.

---
### Homogeneous System
The dimensionless homogeneous GPE is defined as
![H_GPE](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?i%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5Cpsi%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20t%7D=-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cnabla%5E2%5Cpsi%2B%7C%5Cpsi%7C%5E2%5Cpsi%2BV%5Cpsi-%5Cpsi%2Biv_%7Bob%7D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5Cpsi%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20x%7D),  
where ![psi](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cpsi) is the condensate wavefunction, ![V](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V) is a potential allowing for obstacles and ![v_ob](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_{ob}) is the fluid velocity along the x direction.  

This version of the GPE is valid when properties are scaled with the so called '**natural units**'


![Natural Scaling](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B110%7D%20%5C%5C%5Cmathrm%7BDensity%7Eat%7Einfinity%3A%7D%7En_0%20%5C%5C%5Cmathrm%7BLength%3A%7D%7E%5Cxi%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Chbar%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7Bm%5Cmu%7D%7D%20%5C%5C%5Cmathrm%7BEnergy%3A%7D%7E%5Cmu%20%3D%20n_0g%20%5C%5C%5Cmathrm%7BVelocity%3A%7D%7Ec%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn_0g%7D%7D%7Bm%7D%20%5C%5C%5Cmathrm%7BTime%3A%7D%7E%5Cfrac%7B%5Cxi%7D%7Bc%7D)

Running multiple simulations sequentially at varying velocities is supported. The solver will first run a simulation at the ![v_ob](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_{ob}) defined by `VOBS`.
Once complete the solver will increase ![v_ob](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_{ob}) by the amount defined by `VOBST` and rerun the simulation. This will continue until ![v_ob](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_{ob})
is larger than the value defined by `VOBE` at which point the solver will terminate.

The following parameters can be modified,

Parameter | Default | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
`RHSType` | `0` | GPE Type - Set to `0` for **natural units**, `1` for **harmonic oscillator units**.
`VOBS` | `0` | First simulation's velocity. ![v_ob](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_{ob}=) ![v_ob](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi{80}~%5Cmathrm{VOBS}/100).
`VOBE` | `0` | Final simulation's velocity. This is ![v_ob](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_{ob}=) ![v_ob](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi{80}~%5Cmathrm{VOBE}/100).
`VOBST` | `1` | Increase ![v_ob](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_{ob}) by ![v_ob](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi{80}%5Cmathrm{VOBST}/100) per simulation.

### Harmonically Trapped System
The dimensionless GPE in a harmonically trapped system is defined as  
![T_GPE](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?i%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5Cpsi%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20t%7D=-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cnabla%5E2%5Cpsi%2Bg_{2D}%7C%5Cpsi%7C%5E2%5Cpsi%2BV%5Cpsi-%5Cmu_{2D}%5Cpsi),  
where ![psi](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cpsi) is the condensate wavefunction, ![g2d](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?g_{2D}) is the interaction strength, ![V](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V) is a potential allowing for a harmonic trap and/or obstacles, and ![mu2d](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmu_{2D}) is the chemical potential.

This version of the GPE is valid when properties are scaled with the so called '**harmonic oscillator units**'


![HO_Scaling](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi{120}%20%5C%5C%5Cmathrm{Energy%3A}~%5Cmu%20%3D%20%5Chbar%20%5Comega_r%20%5C%5C%5Cmathrm{Length%3A}~%5Cl_r%20%3D%20%5Csqrt{%5Cfrac{%5Chbar}{m%5Comega_r}}%20%5C%5C%5Cmathrm{Time%3A}~%20%5Comega_r^{-1},)

where ![omega_r](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Comega_r) is the trap frequency in the radial direction.  
*NB. Strictly speaking, a 2D mean-field description of an oblate trapped condensate is only valid when ![condition](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi{100}Nal_z^3/l_r^3%5Cll1), where N is the number of atoms, a is the s-wave scattering length and ![l_z](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi{100}%5Cl_z%20%3D%20%5Csqrt{%5Chbar/m%5Comega_z}) and ![l_r](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi{100}%5Cl_r%20%3D%20%5Csqrt{%5Chbar/m%5Comega_r}) are the axial and radial harmonic oscillator lengths.*

The following parameters are related to the harmonically trapped system.

Parameter | Default | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
`RHSType` | `0` | GPE Type - Set to `0` for **natural units**, `1` for **harmonic oscillator units**.
`harm_osc_C` | `100` | Value of ![g2d](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?g_{2D})
`harm_osc_mu` | `5` | Value of ![mu2d](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmu_{2D})
`enableTrap` |`.true.`| Enable or disable the trapping potential
---
### Damped GPE
For both cases of the GPE, an optional damping parameter can be applied, allowing for simulations using the Damped GPE. The damped version of the GPE as a rough and rudimentary simulation of finite temperature effects on BECs.  
The damped GPE is found by replacing the left hand side of the GPE with,  
![T_GPE][dgpe]
[dgpe]: http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(i-%5Cgamma)%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%5Cpsi%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20t%7D=
where ![gamma](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cgamma) is a small positive real parameter controlling the strength of the damping.

In damped GPE simulations, the condensate norm can also be renormalised at every iteration, preventing atom loss for large damping parameters.  

Parameter | Default | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
`GAMMAC` | `0` | Value of ![gamma](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cgamma)
`rtNorm` |`.false.`| If `.true.` the wavefunction is normalised at every time step
---
# Numerical Method
2D-GP uses 4th order Runge-Kutta time stepping on a grid of points with regular spacing in both the x and y dimensions.  
The solver begins by finding an inital condition using the *imaginary time method*, which obtains a steady solution known as the *ground state*. An optional random perturbation can then be applied to this initial condition.  
The solver then runs in *real time* producing a solution to the GPE for the given parameters.


The following parameters can be customised,  

Parameter | Default | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
`NX` | `512` | Number of grid points in the x direction
`NY` | `512` | Number of grid points in the y direction
`DSPACE` | `0.05` | Grid spacing in dimensionless units
`DTSIZE` | `0.001` | Time step size in dimensionless units
`ISTEPS` | `2000` | Number of iterations to run the solver in the *imaginary time method*
`NSTEPS` | `10000` | Number of iterations to run the solver in real time
`noiseamp` | `0` | Amplitude of random noise to add to the ground state initial condition

### Boundary Conditions
Both **reflective** and **periodic** boundary conditions are supported.

Parameter | Default | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
`BCX` | `0` | Boundary conditions in the x direction - Set to `0` for **reflective**, `1` for **periodic**.
`BCY` | `0` | Boundary conditions in the y direction - Set to `0` for **reflective**, `1` for **periodic**.

# Output Data
Data is output every set amount of time steps. This output frequency can be easily customised

Parameter | Default | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
`dumpd`  | `100` | Density output frequency
`dumpwf` | `100` | Wavefunction output frequency
`dumputil` | `100` | Force/energy internal calculation frequency

###Density Files

Density files are output with the filename: `vvvv.dump.ssss`. Here `vvvv` is the current obstacle speed, *v*, multiplied by 100 and `ssss` is the number of the output file. e.g `0100.dump.0000`.

Density files are structured in rows with each row corresponding to a single point in space:

Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 |
--- | --- | --- | ---
*x* coordinate | *y* coordinate |Density at (*x*,*y*)|Fluid velocity at (*x*,*y*)


###Wavefunction Files

Wavefunction files are output with the filename: `vvvv.dumpwf.ssss`. Here `vvvv` is the current obstacle speed, *v*, multiplied by 100 and `ssss` is the number of the output file. e.g `0100.dumpwf.0000`.

Wavefunction files are structured in rows with each row corresponding to a single point in space:

Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
*x* coordinate | *y* coordinate |Real part of wavefunction at (*x*,*y*)|Imaginary part of wavefunction at (*x*,*y*) | Potential at (*x*,*y*)

###Internal calculation frequency

The fluid force and energy is calculated by default every 100 time steps. If rotating or oscillating obstacles are used it my be useful to reduce the `dumputil` frequency.  

The solver will also output a file, named `utils.vvvv` (Here `vvvv` is the current obstacle speed, *v*, multiplied by 100), output at the same frequency.
This file is in the following format:

Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4
--- | --- | --- | ---
Time, *t* | Total energy of the fluid at *t* | Net force in the *x* direction at *t* | Net force in the *y* direction at *t*

###File size
The output files are designed to be human readable and easily read by several data analysis or data visualising programs. However, this means the output file sizes can be very large, particularly for the density and wavefunction files. Do note however the files produced by 2D-GP compress *very well*, should file size become an issue.

# Potential Trap and Obstacles
A harmonic potential trap, obstacles with various properties, and loading of heightmap data is supported.
The potential must be globally enabled before enabling the trap or obstacle.

Parameter | Default | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
`enablePot` | `.true.` | Enable the potential term in the GPE globally.
`enableTrap` | `.true.` | Enable the potential trap.
`potType` | `-1` | Obstacle type - Set to `-1` for no obstacle, `0` for a fixed Gaussian "laser beam", `1` for a freely rotating Gaussian obstacle, `2` for an oscillating Gaussian obstacle, or `3` for a heightmap potential.
`potRep` | `0` | Set to `0` to calculate the potential once (for fixed potentials). Set to `1` if the potential varies in time and must be recalculated at every time step.
---

### Potential Trap
The potential trap is used to confine the fluid, emulating BEC experiments. When enabled a harmonic trapping potential is used and is of the form
![V_trap][vtrap].
[vtrap]: http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Btrap%7D%7D%28x%2Cy%29%3Dm%5Comega_r%5E2%28[x-x_0]%5E2&plus;[y-y_0]%5E2%29/2

Parameter | Default | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
`TXDASH`|`0`| Value for ![x_0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_0), center of the harmonic trap in *x*.
`TYDASH`|`0`| Value for ![y_0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y_0), center of the harmonic trap in *y*.

An optional mode can be enabled emulating an experiment where an oblate BEC was dragged around a stationary laser obstacle by translating the trap.
The simulation starts with a stationary trap. The velocity of the trap is increased to its maximum, and finally is slowed down back to stationary after a fixed period of time.

Parameter | Default | Explanation

`doShin` | `.false.` | Optional translated trap mode - set to `.false.` for a stationary trap,  `.true.` for a moving trap.
`TVXDASH` | `0` | Trap's maximum velocity in the *x* direction.
`TVYDASH`| `0` | Trap's maximum velocity in the *y* direction.
`TTM`| `0` | Amount of time the trap will be moving.

---

### Gaussian Obstacles
When enabled, a Gaussian Obstacle is added to the potential in the form  
 ![V_obs][vobs],  
where ![rxy](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r_x,r_y) are the obstacle radius and ![x0y0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_0,y_0) are the obstacle position. ![V0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V_0) is a measure of the strength of the gaussian beam, measured in units of ![mu](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmu).
[vobs]: http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V_%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bobs%7D%7D%28x%2Cy%29%3DV_0%5Cmathrm%7Bexp%7D%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7B%28x-x_0%29%5E2%7D%7Br_x%5E2%7D&plus;%5Cfrac%7B%28y-y_0%29%5E2%7D%7Br_y%5E2%7D%5Cright%5D

The following parameters must be set for any of the Gaussian obstacles

Parameter | Default | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
`RRX`|`2.0`| Value for ![rx](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r_x), radius in the *x* direction.
`RRY`|`2.0`| Value for ![ry](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r_y), radius in the *y* direction.
`OBJXDASH` | `0` | Value for ![x0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_0), the obstacle's *x* position.
`OBJYDASH` | `0` | Value for ![y0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y_0), the obstacle's *y* position.
`OBJHEIGHT`| `0` | Value for ![V0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V_0), the barrier height. The default height of  of 0 is equivalent to no obstacle.

### Rotating Obstacle
A rotating obstacle can be enabled. The obstacle can then rotate freely about its center, and reacts to forces and pressures exerted by the fluid.  Here the obstacle has an initial angle, initial angular velocity and a moment of inertia.
This mode only really makes sense for an elliptical obstacle.

Parameter | Default | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
`OBJANGLE`|`0.1`|Initial obstacle velocity
`OBJANGLEV`|`0.1`|Initial angular velocity
`MOMINERTIA`|`0.000001`| Obstacle's [Moment of Inertia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia)

### Oscillating Obstacle
An oscillating obstacle can be enabled, emulating wires or tuning forks as used in liquid helium experiments. The obstacle acts like a forced harmonic oscillator, damped by any net forces and pressure exerted by the fluid.
Setting the forcing frequency to approximately the obstacle's natural frequency will induce resonance.

Parameter | Default | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
`FVAL`|`0`|Amplitude of forced oscillation
`WF`|`0.1`|Frequency of forced oscillation
`W0`|`0.05`| Obstacle's [natural frequency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_frequency).

###Surface Potential
**TODO: Expand this section.**  
*N.B. The surface code is NOT user friendly at the moment and needs updating so that general data can be used.*

Parameter | Default | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
`afm_filename`|` `| Location of the AFM data
`afmRES`| `256` | Resolution of the AFM data
`afmSlice` | `120` | Which slice (y value) to use
`xi1` | `0.066`| Value of \xi to use (for converting metres to dimless units)
`afmXScale`|`0.035`| Scale the data in the *x* direction by this value
`afmYscale`|`1`| Scale the data in the *y* direction by this value
`TRUNCPARAM` | `1`| Truncate the data at this amount (in units of the maximum point)

#Example `params.in`

An example (and default) `params.in` is provided by 2D-GP, and looks like this:
```
!Enter custom parameters in the form
!PARAMETER_NAME = VALUE
!
NX = 128
NY = 128
BCX = 1
BCY = 1
```

This should show you enough to work out how to use the parameters shown throught this document.
